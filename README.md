# mwi - modern web initializer

mwi does trivial and boring initial configuration procedure for you, which all
modern web apps require. Why copy & paste & edit a dozen files when few answers
can do the same job?

## features

- git & npm initialization
- cherry picking setup among popular libraries (react, angular, ...)
- plus frontend framework (bootstrap, semantic-ui, ...)
- rollup / webpack + babel configuration

Note that mwi has nothing to do with the backend of the app.
